- Hi, I’m @Hem-Desai a Software developer from Ahmedabad, building stuff.
- Welcome to my little corner of the internet, where I turn caffeine and curiosity into softwares (hopefully working).
- I'm all about Project-Based Learning (PBL) — tackling real-world problems while constantly evolving my skills. My toolbelt includes a swiss knife.
