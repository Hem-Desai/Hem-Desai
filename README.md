- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Hem-Desai
- I'm a developer focused on Python-based projects, diving into everything from LLMs to back-end development with Flask, data science, and even some 8-bit games.
- I'm all about Project-Based Learning (PBL) â€” tackling real-world problems while constantly evolving my skills. My toolbelt includes Python, C++, JS, and the Flask framework. Right now, I'm expanding my horizons with Node and React.
- GitHub is my playground, but also a space where potential employers can see my work and attest to what I bring to the table. I like to keep it both fun and professional, so feel free to explore my projects!
