- Hi, I’m @Hem-Desai
- I'm a developer focused on Python-based projects, diving into everything from LLMs to back-end development with Flask, data science, and even some 8-bit games.
- I'm all about Project-Based Learning (PBL) — tackling real-world problems while constantly evolving my skills. My toolbelt includes Python, C++, JS, and the Flask framework. Right now, I'm exploring more of Web Development.
